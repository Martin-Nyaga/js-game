Doing now
- Capture mouse clicks?

Keep in mind

- I just realised that the implications of WebGls axis scheme means that
  having non-square maps is nasty. So while canvas can be any size.
  Practically, I will limit maps to square sizes.

To do at some point

- Understand the difference between WebGL1
  and WebGL2, and see if it's relevant
- Test on different screen resolutions, to see how WebGL drawing changes
