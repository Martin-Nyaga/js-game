Doing now
- First thing is to allow the player to be able to mine some type of resource,
  probably coal makes the most sense. So I will need a type of coal object,
  which is mineable, then I will need to be able to handle the clicking and
  mining of that object, and finally, I will need to handle transferring that
  object to some kind of inventory.

Keep in mind
- I just realised that the implications of WebGls axis scheme means that having
  non-square maps is tricky. So while canvas can be any size, practically, I
  will limit maps to square sizes.

To do at some point

- Understand the difference between WebGL1 and WebGL2, and see if it's relevant
- Test on different screen resolutions, to see how WebGL drawing changes
